# LettersBotPY
LettersBot 2.0, if you will. Marginally better &amp; rewritten in Python. dread

## Setup?
I'm not sure how well it runs or works on anything other than 64-bit Python 3.8.2 but good luck if you want to do that
You'll need an environment variable called BOT_TOKEN, containing the token of the discord bot you want to run this as
### Deps
- discord‏.‏py
- optionally, jishaku for debugging
